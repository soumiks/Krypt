# Krypt — Biometric Data Sovereignty

**Krypt** is a decentralized, open-source personal data vault where your body is the key.

## 🔐 Core Concept

- **You Own It:** Your private data (identity, medical, financial) is encrypted and stored on decentralized networks (IPFS/Arweave).
- **Biometric Keys:** Encryption keys are derived directly from your biometrics (fingerprint/face) on-device. No central server holds your keys.
- **Time-Limited Sharing:** Share specific chunks of data with vendors for a limited time. Keys expire automatically.
- **Audit Trail:** Every access grant is recorded on-chain (Base L2) for full transparency.
